        Ninja::$request->action     --> Ninja::$request->getActionName()

        db->update(            =>  db->updateObject(
        db->row(               =>  db->fetchRow(

        db->getLastInsertID()    =>  db->lastInsertId()

        db->insertMultiple(      => db->insertMany(

        class Product extends Ninja_Controller  => Controller_Product
        class Edit extends Ninja_Controller (at controller/modules/meetings/Edit.php) now becomes
        => classController_Modules_Meetings_Edit at controller/Modules/Meetings/Edit.php (case sensitive directory names)
